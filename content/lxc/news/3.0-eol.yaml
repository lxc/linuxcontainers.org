  # Introduction
  The 3.0 LTS branch has reached its end of life.

  This affects the following projects:

   - LXC 3.0 (released 27th of March 2018)
   - LXCFS 3.0 (released 26th of March 2018)
   - LXD 3.0 (released 2nd of April 2018)

  After over 5 years of bugfixes and security maintenance, those releases have now reached the end of their supported lifetime.

  Concretely, this means that we will not be issuing any new releases, that our stable branches will be closed and associated CI disabled.

  All remaining users should upgrade to a supported release as soon as possible.

  # Long term support releases
  Upstream commits to 5 years support for its LTS branches.
  Such branches exist for LXC, LXCFS and LXD and see bugfixes and security fixes backported to them.

  No new features get added to those branches and only the latest LTS branch sees most bugfixes backported, once a new LTS branch is released, the previous one will only get security and critical bugfixes.

  # Currently supported releases
  There are currently two remaining LTS releases, `4.0` with support lasting until June 2025 and `5.0` with support until June 2027.

  Additionally, some projects (currently LXD) may have more frequent feature releases. Those do not get long term support and are usually only supported until the next one comes out.
