title: LXC 1.0.6 release announcement
date: 2014/09/24 00:00
content: |-
  This is the sixth bugfix release for the LXC 1.0 series.
  
  To make supporting both LXC 1.0 and the future LXC 1.1 easier, this version introduces the -F argument to lxc-start.
  This argument is a no-op as lxc-start is already running in the foreground by default, but as that behavior will change in LXC 1.1,
  introducing -F in 1.0 too allows for writing script which will work consistently on upgrades.
