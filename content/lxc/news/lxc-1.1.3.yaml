title: LXC 1.1.3 release announcement
date: 2015/08/14 00:00
content: |-
  This is the third bugfix release for LXC 1.1.
  
  ### Changes
  
  Important:
  
   * Security fix for CVE-2015-1331
   * Security fix for CVE-2015-1334
   * Fix an ABI regression in LXC 1.1 compared to LXC 1.0.
     Fixing this unfortunately means that binaries built against LXC
     1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 will need rebuilding against LXC 1.1.3.
     This is however preferable to not having backward compatibility with
     binaries built for LXC 1.0 and its bugfix releases.
