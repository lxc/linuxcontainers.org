title: LXC 1.0.5 release announcement
date: 2014/07/14 00:00
content: |-
  This is the fifth bugfix release for the LXC 1.0 series.
  
  # seccomp profile
  Outside of the usual bugfixes, this release also introduces one important change.
  For systems where LXC is built with seccomp support, containers will now have a seccomp profile enabled
  which will prevent calls to the following syscalls:
  
   * kexec\_load
   * open\_by\_handle\_at
   * init\_module
   * finit\_module,
   * delete\_module.
  
  This will amongst other things prevent exploits like the recently release "shocker" exploit.
  
  This profile will be applied to any new or existing container that uses the new-style LXC configurations
  (using lxc.include of common configs), so currently the following distributions:
  centos, debian, fedora, gentoo, oracle, plamo and ubuntu.
  
  You can turn this off by adding "lxc.seccomp =" in your container's configuration.
  
  If you want to manually turn this on for a container which doesn't use the common config mechanism,
  you can add something like "lxc.seccomp = /usr/share/lxc/config/common.seccomp" to the container configuration.
