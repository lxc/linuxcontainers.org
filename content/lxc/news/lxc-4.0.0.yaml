  ### Introduction
  The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 4.0.0!

  This is the result of two years of work since the LXC 3.0.0 release and is the third LTS release for the LXC project. This release will be supported until June 2025.

  ### Major changes

  #### cgroups: Full cgroup2 support
  LXC 4.0 now fully supports the unified cgroup hierarchy. For this to work the whole cgroup driver had to be rewritten. A consequence of this work is that the cgroup layout for LXC containers had to be changed. Older versions of LXC used the layout:

      /sys/fs/cgroup/<controller>/<container-name>/

  For example, in the legacy cgroup hierarchy the `cpuset` hierarchy would place the container 's init process into

      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/c1/

  The supervising monitor process would stay in

      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/

  LXC 4.0 uses the layout:

      /sys/fs/cgroup/<controller>/lxc.payload.<container-name>/

  For the `cpuset` controller in the legacy cgroup hierarchy for the container `f2` the cgroup would be:

      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/lxc.payload.f2/

  The monitor process now moves into a separate cgroup as well:

      /sys/fs/cgroup/<controller>/lxc.monitor.<container-name>/

  For our example this would be:

      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/lxc.monitor.f2/

  The monitor's and the container's cgroup will be placed on the same level in the corresponding cgroup hierarchy.
  These changes apply to the legacy and the unified hierarchy alike and are not arbitrary. The new, unified cgroup hierarchy imposes specific restrictions where and how a process can be migrated in the cgroup hierarchy.  The most important restriction is the leaf-node restriction. This means that only leaf nodes can contain live processes, i.e. if you have the following cgroup tree

   
      /sys/fs/cgroup/a/f2-monitor/f2-container/

  then only `f2-container` can contain live processes whereas non-leaf nodes `a` and `f2-monitor` do not. This has the consequence that the old cgroup layout LXC used where the monitor process would have lived in `f2-monitor` and the container's init process would have lived in `f2-container` is not possible anymore. The kernel disallows this layout. Instead, the monitor process and the container's init process need to be moved into two leaf-node cgroups on the same level in the cgroup hierarchy. This would mean for a container `f2` the layout will be:


      /sys/fs/cgroup/lxc.monitor.f2/

  and

      /sys/fs/cgroup/lxc.payload.f2/

  The restrictions enforced by the unified cgroup hierarchy also mean, that in order to start fully unprivileged containers cooperation is needed on distributions that make use of an init system which manages cgroups. This applies to all distributions that use systemd as their init system. When a container is started from the shell via `lxc-start` or other means one either needs to be root to allow LXC to escape to the root cgroup or the init system needs to be instructed to delegate an empty cgroup. In such scenarios it is wise to set the configuration key `lxc.cgroup.relative` to `1` to prevent LXC from escaping to the root cgroup.

  #### cgroups: Freezer support in CGroup2
  As part of the cgroup2 support work for LXC 4.0 we also added support for cgroup2's implementation of the freezer controller which allows to poll until the cgroup is frozen or unfrozen making freezing and unfreezing container's way more reliable than before.

  #### cgroups: eBPF device controller support in CGroup2
  LXC 4.0 can now make proper use of the cgroup2 device controller. It will automatically create, load, and attach a eBPF program to the container's cgroup and supports dynamic additional and removal of rules. The configuration format is the same as for the legacy cgroup controller. Only the `lxc.cgroup2.devices.` prefix instead of the legacy `lxc.cgroup.devices` prefix needs to be used. LXC continues to support both black- and whitelists.

  #### AppArmor: Deny access to `/proc/acpi/**`
  The default AppArmor profile now denies access to `/proc/acpi/` improving safety.

  #### config: Add `lxc.autodev.tmpfs.size` configuration key
  LXC supports creating a useable minimal `/dev` directory for the container by setting `lxc.autodev = 1` in the container's config file. To do this LXC sets up a `tmpfs` mount on `/dev`. This `tmpfs` mount could not be restricted in prior releases. Now it is possible to set a limit on the size of the `tmpfs` mount by setting `lxc.autodev.tmpfs.size` to the number of bytes that the `tmpfs` should be restricted to use.

  #### config: Add `lxc.selinux.context.keyring` key
  This allows to specify the `selinux` context to be used for the keyring the container uses.

  #### config: Add `lxc.keyring.session`
  Setting this to `1` (default) will cause LXC to create a new session keyring.

  #### file utils: Add `fopen_cached()` and `fdopen_cached`
  These helpers first read a whole file and then make it available as a stream to be read via regular file-based libc apis. This makes LXC's handling of various files more robust where the underlying file can change while it is read.

  #### api: Add new `init_pidfd()` member
  LXC 4.0 fully supports the new pidfd kernel api the LXC team has merged in the upstream Linux kernel. The `pidfd` of the container's init process can be requested via `c->init_pidfd(c)`.

  #### memory utils: Add new cleanup api
  LXC 4.0 expands the usage of the compiler's cleanup attribute by introducing new internal apis to define and call cleanup macros for complex resource allocations. We have had extremely positive results decreasing bugs around file descriptor and memory leaks significantly by switching to this new way of cleaning up resources.

  #### lxc-usernsexec: Make it easy to map own uid
  The `lxc-usernsexec` binary now finds a default mapping as specified in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` and writes it via `newuidmap` and `newgidmap`.

  #### seccomp: Add s390 support
  LXC 4.0's seccomp implementation now supports s390 as architecture.

  #### syscalls: Improve manual syscall implementations
  Whenever a given syscall is not supported or exposed by the underlying `C` library of the system LXC will define syscall stubs for important syscalls or new features it deems extremely valuable. This used to be done by checking for `__NR_<syscall-name>` being defined. But `__NR_<syscall-name>` being defined depended on the correct headers for the currently running kernel LXC was compiled on being installed and would be problematic whenever LXC was compiled on a system running an older kernel but used or deployed on systems that use a new kernel. In such scenarios LXC could not make use of new kernel features even though it should. We now introduce definitions for `__NR_<syscall-name>` whenever the system does not define it already and it is an architecture we support (which is basically any architecture). This way we better handle kernel <-> header version mismatches and compilation <-> deployment kernel mismatches.

  #### network: Improved network device creation and removal
  We have reworked how network devices are created, tracked, moved between network namespaces, and are removed making low-level network management way more reliable.

  #### network: Allow moving wireless devices
  LXC allowed to move wireless network devices (`nl80211`) into containers. This was broken for a while. With 4.0 the abilito to move wireless network devices is restored and improved.

  ### Support and upgrade
  LXC 4.0.0 will be supported until June 2025 and our current LTS release, LXC 3.0 will now switch to a slower maintenance pace, only getting critical bugfixes and security updates.

  We strongly recommend all LXC users to plan an upgrade to the 4.0 branch.
