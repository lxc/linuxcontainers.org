  ### Downloads
  The release tarballs may be found on our [download page](/lxc/downloads/) and we expect most distributions
  will very soon ship a packaged version of LXC 1.0.11.
  
  Please note that LXC upstream strongly recommends 1.0 users to upgrade to the 2.0 LTS release.
  The 1.0 branch will keep being supported until June 2019, but at this point,
  only critical bugfixes and security updates will be backported.
  
  Should you be interested in individual changes or just looking at the detailed development history,
  our stable branch is on [GitHub](https://github.com/lxc/lxc/tree/stable-1.0).
