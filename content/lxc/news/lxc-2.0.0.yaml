  The LXC team is very pleased to announce the release of LXC 2.0!
  
  ### Highlights
  
   * All main LXC commands have now been rewritten in C
      * lxc-ls
      * lxc-device
      * lxc-copy
   * New lxc-copy command taking over the role of lxc-clone and lxc-start-ephemeral
   * Much improved support for checkpoint/restore of containers
   * Completely reworked cgroup handling including support for the cgroup namespace
   * The various command line tools are now much more consistent
   * Re-organized storage backend implementation, including addition of a Ceph RBD backend
   * An enormous amount of bugfixes, most of which will be backported to 1.0 and 1.1 over the next few bugfix releases
   * The C API remains backward compatible with previous versions and is released as 1.2
  
  This release was made possible by contributions (720 commits) from a total of 96 contributors.
  
  ### New configuration options
  
   * lxc.ephemeral: Controls whether the container is ephemeral and so will be destroyed on shutdown
   * lxc.rebootsignal: Allows to override the signal sent for container reboot
   * lxc.hook.destroy: New hook being called on container destruction
   * lxc.hook.stop: Run in the host context with references to the containers just before namespace teardown
   * lxc.init\_uid: Used by lxc-execute to set an alternative user
   * lxc.init\_gid: Used by lxc-execute to set an alternative group
   * lxc.monitor.unshare: Allows unsharing the mount namespace prior to running any hook
  
  ### New features
  
   * API:
      * API version is 1.2, fully backward compatible with 1.1 and 1.0
      * new symbols:
           * New migrate() symbol as an alternative to checkpoint() using a migrate_opts struct to simplify additions

      * lua
           * Add support for get_ips()
           * Add support for get_interfaces()

      * config: lxc.rootfs.backend: Allows to override the storage backend (bypasses auto-detection)
      * config: New nesting.conf configuration file to setup container nesting
      * hooks: New LXC\_CGNS\_AWARE environment variable, set to 1 if LXC supports the cgroup namespace (the kernel however may not)
      * hooks: New LXC\_SRC\_NAME environment variable is set in clone hook with the original container name
      * hooks: New LXC\_TARGET environment variable is set with the container goal (stop or reboot)
      * logging: Updated logging timestamps to be a bit more readable
      * lxc-usernet: Support for containers usning a veth interface without bridging
      * lxc-usernet: Support for group-based quotas (use the @ prefix)
      * network: The bridge interface MTU is now used as the default container interface MTU

      * storage: New Ceph RBD storage backend
   * Documentation:

      * ubuntu: New -v option allowing the user to set the debootstrap variant
      * ubuntu-cloud: Support for vendor-data passthrough
  
  ### Change in behavior
  
   * The lxc-autostart container startup order is now reversed (to be correct)
   * The new cgfsng cgroup backend is now the recommended backend
   * lxc.hook.post-stop failures are now fatal to container reboots
  
  Note that several commands have been significantly reworked in this release.
  We don't consider our command line tools as stable ABI so you may need to test and adapt your scripts,
  or better, port them to use our stable C API or one of its bindings.
  
  ### Deprecation warnings
  
  The "lxc-clone" and "lxc-start-ephemeral" commands are now considered deprecated and to be replaced by the new lxc-copy.
  Those commands can still be built by using the --enable-legacy flag, however note that they will print a warning when used
  and that they will be removed from upcoming LXC releases.
  
  ### Support
  This is the second LXC Long Term Support release which we will be supporting until the 1st of June 2021.
  LXC 1.0, our previous Long Term Support release, is still supported until the 1st of June 2019.
  And lastly, the previous stable release, LXC 1.1 will go end of life on the 1st of September 2016.
  
  ### Downloads
  The release tarballs may be found on our [download page](/lxc/downloads/) and we expect most distributions
  will very soon ship a packaged version of LXC 2.0.0.
