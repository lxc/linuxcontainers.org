  This is the second bugfix release for LXC 2.0.

   * apparmor: add make-rslave to usr.bin.lxc-start
   * apparmor: Allow bind-mounts and {r}shared/{r}private
   * apparmor: allow mount move
   * apparmor: Update mount states handling
   * core: Drop lxc-devsetup as unneeded by current autodev
   * core: Fix redefinition of struct in6\_addr
   * core: Include all lxcmntent.h function declarations on Bionic
   * c/r: c/r: use criu's "full" mode for cgroups
   * systemd: start containers in foreground when using the lxc@.service
   * templates: debian: Make sure init is installed
   * templates: oracle: Fix console login
   * templates: plamo: Fix various issues
   * templates: ubuntu: Install apt-transport-https by default
   * travis: ensure 'make install' doesn't fail
   * travis: test VPATH builds
   * upstart: Force lxc-instance to behave like a good Upstart client
