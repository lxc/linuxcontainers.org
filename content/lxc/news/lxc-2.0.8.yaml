title: LXC 2.0.8 release announcement
date: 2017/05/11 00:00
content: |-
  This is the eighth bugfix release for LXC 2.0.
  
  Important:
  
   * Security fix for CVE-2017-5985
   * All templates have been updated to not set default passwords anymore,
     instead requiring lxc-attach be used to configure users.
     This may affect some automated environments that were relying on our
     default (very much insecure) users.
