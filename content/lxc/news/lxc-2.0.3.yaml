title: LXC 2.0.3 release announcement
date: 2016/06/28 00:00
content: |-
  This is the third bugfix release for LXC 2.0.
  
  LXC 2.0.3 was released just minutes after LXC 2.0.2 as we spotted an incorrect
  AppArmor profile included in the LXC 2.0.2 release tarball.
  
  The main bugfixes in this release are:
  
   * apparmor: Refresh generated file
  
  ### Downloads
  The release tarballs may be found on our [download page](/lxc/downloads/) and we expect most distributions
  will very soon ship a packaged version of LXC 2.0.3.
  
  Should you be interested in individual changes or just looking at the detailed development history,
  our stable branch is on [GitHub](https://github.com/lxc/lxc/tree/stable-2.0).
