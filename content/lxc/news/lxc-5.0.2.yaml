  ### Introduction
  The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 5.0.2!

  This is the second bugfix release for LXC 5.0 which is supported until June 2027.

  ### Security fix
  This release does fix one CVE which was recently open against LXC.
  [CVE-2022-47952](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47952) covers the use of `lxc-user-nic` (setuid binary) as a way to uncover the existence of files at locations which would normally not be accessible to the user.

  This is classified as a low severity CVE and was reported to us publicly through Github along with a fix. Given this was not released under embargo and given the low impact of this issue, we made the decision to process it as we would any other bugfix to liblxc.

  ### Bugfixes
  As usual this bugfix releases focus on stability and hardening.

  Some of the highlights for this release are:

   - Fix a variety of build issues resulting from the switch to meson
   - lxc-attach: Fix missing return codes
   - core: Setup peer group for container's root
   - checkconfig: Make output more useful on modern kernels
   - lxc-user-nic: Fix issue resulting in leaking file existence to unprivileged users (CVE-2022-47952)
