   - When an item is added to an array, then the array is realloc()ed (to size+1), and the item is copied (strdup()) to the array. Thus, when an item is removed from an array, memory allocated for that item should be freed, successive items should be left-shifted and the array realloc()ed again (size-1).
   - Resize array in remove_from_array() and fix a crash
   - lxc-download: Switch GPG server
   - cgroups: verify that hierarchies are non-empty
