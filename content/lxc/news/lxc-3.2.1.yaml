  # Introduction
  The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 3.2.1!

  Because of an issue in the 3.2.0 release process, we ended up having to roll a 3.2.1 release almost immediately, fixing an issue in the `configure.ac` file identifying the release as stable.

  # New features

  ## seccomp: Support syscall forwarding to userspace
  Newer kernels allow seccomp to forward intercepted syscalls to a dedicated file descriptor. These messages can be read, the syscall arguments inspected, and if found secure, a sufficiently privileged userspace process can perform the actions normally done by the kernel for the container.
  LXC introduces a new protocol to send and receive messages to another process. User can specify a unix socket address via `lxc.seccomp.notify.proxy` in the format `unix:<path>` to which LXC will forward the intercepted syscalls and will wait for an appropriate response.
  User can set a cookie via `lxc.seccomp.notify.cookie` that LXC will send back to process that reads forwarded syscalls. This will e.g. allow the listening process to identify which container sent a message.
  With this feature LXD e.g. supports device node creation via the `mknod()` and `mknodat()` system calls that are usually forbidden in containers for a well-defined set of secure devices.

  ## Add `lxc.seccomp.allow_nesting` configuration key
  This release adds the lxc.seccomp.allow_nesting api extension. If `lxc.seccomp.allow_nesting` is set to 1 then seccomp profiles will be stacked. This way nested containers can load their own seccomp policy on top of the policy that the outer container might have applied.

  ## Networking: Add IPVLAN support
  LXC has gained support for IPVLAN. Here is an example how to setup the network:

      lxc.net[i].type=ipvlan
      lxc.net[i].ipvlan.mode=[l3|l3s|l2] (defaults to l3)
      lxc.net[i].ipvlan.flags=[bridge|private|vepa] (defaults to bridge)
      lxc.net[i].link=eth0
      lxc.net[i].flags=up

  ## Networking: Add layer 2 (ARP/NDP) proxy mode
  LXC now supports layer 2 ARP/NDP proxy mode. This can be enabled by using:

      lxc.net.[i].l2proxy = [0,1] (defaults to 0)

  ## Networking: Add gateway device route mode
  LXC now supports specifying `lxc.net.[i].ipv4.gateway` and/or `lxc.net.[i].ipv6.gateway` with a value of `dev`. This will cause LXC to set a device route as default gateway.

  ## Networking: Add support for static routes
  This release introudces two new configuration keys

      lxc.net.[i].veth.ipv4.route
      lxc.net.[i].veth.ipv6.route

  which allow users to set static routes on a veth type interfaces.

  ## Networking: Add router veth mode
  LXC has gained a new router mode for veth networking. This "router" mode will configure the host machine as a router for the container by adding static routes for the container's IPs on the host pointing to the container's host-side veth interface. It will also add static IP proxy entries of either the host's link interface IP or a statically set IP on the host-side veth interface to provide the container a gateway to the host.

  Here is an example how to setup the network:

      lxc.net.0.type = veth
      lxc.net.0.veth.mode = router
      lxc.net.0.link = eth0
      lxc.net.0.flags = up
      lxc.net.0.ipv4.address = 192.168.1.x/32
      lxc.net.0.ipv6.address = 2a02:xxx:xxx:1::x/128
      lxc.net.0.ipv4.gateway = auto
      lxc.net.0.ipv6.gateway = auto
      lxc.net.0.link = host-eth0
      lxc.net.0.l2proxy = 1
     
  This provides an ipvlan-like networking mode that has the following properties:

  * Works on older kernels.
  * Uses the host's routing table (and netfilter rules) to route packets (potentially out of different interfaces or between containers), unlike ipvlan.
  * Prevents containers from altering their IP.
  * Prevents broadcast/multicast traffic to/from containers.
  * Provides same MAC externally for all containers.
  * No bridge interface to manage.
  * Supports layer 3 only mode for setups where BGP (or other routing protocols) are running on the host to distribute container's IPs in the local routing table to the wider network.
  * Containers can optionally have IPs accessible on local LAN at layer 2 using the existing  `l2proxy` and  `link`  settings.

  ## pidfd: Add initial support for the new pidfd api
  Newer kernel versions allow interaction with processes through process file descriptors (pidfds). This eliminates various race conditions when e.g. sending signals or retrieving process information. This LXC version make use of the pidfd_send_signal() syscall and the CLONE_PIDFD flag with the clone() syscall.

  ## Hardening: Add more compiler based hardening
  Over the last few releases we enabled options compilers provide to harden C codebases. This release enables:

      -Wlogical-op
      -Wmissing-include-dirs
      -Wold-style-definition
      -Winit-self
      -Wfloat-equal
      -Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn
      -Werror=return-type
      -Werror=incompatible-pointer-types
      -Wformat=2
      -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5
      -Wshadow
      -Wendif-labels
      -Werror=overflow
      -fdiagnostics-show-option
      -fstack-protector-strong
      -Werror=shift-count-overflow
      -Werror=shift-overflow=2
      -Wdate-time
      -Wnested-externs
      -fasynchronous-unwind-tables
      -pipe
      -fexceptions

  ## Hardening: Remove all stack allocations
  Stack-based memory allocations (e.g. through `alloca()`) can cause quite severe memory bugs. LXC has therefore removed all stack-based memory allocations and will not allow new code to add any.

  ## Hardening: Add support for [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/lxc/lxc/overview/)
  LXC has gained support for the LGTM code analysis tool. We're happy that LXC's code is currently ranked as A+.

  ## Hardening: Add support for [coccinelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinelle_(software))
  LXC has gained support for the coccinelle code transformation tool. This allows us to automatically change code eliminating error caused by manually replacing e.g. deprecated functions such as `alloca()`.

  ## Hardening: Compiler based resource cleanup
  The codebase will be slowly switched over to make user of cleanup attributes supported by compilers such as `gcc` and `clang`.

  ## Hardening: Remove `fgets()` from the codebase
  To improve security all uses of `fgets()` have been removed from the codebase. Use of this function in new code is strongly discouraged.

  ## Hardening: Expand close-on-exec usage
  All file descriptors that can be made close-on-exec are now close-on-exec.

  ## Use `/sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate` file for cgroup v2
  This  file  exports  a  list  of  the  cgroups  v2  files  (one  per line) that are delegatable (i.e., whose ownership  should  be  changed  to  the  user  ID  of  the delegatee). LXC will use this to determine how to correctly delegate cgroups.

  ## Handle layouts without cgroups
  This lets LXC start containers on systems without writable cgroups.

  ## Handle offline cpus in cpuset
  In addition to removing isolated cpus from a container's cgroup LXC will now also remove offline cpus from the container's cpuset.

  ## Generate new boot id for each container
  LXC will now generate a new random boot id for each container and mount it to `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`. This will allow `systemd` to recognize the boots of each container.

  ## Unified network creation
  LXC has a new unified way of creating networks for privileged and unprivileged containers greatly simplifying the code.

  ## Security: [Fix for runC CVE-2019-5736](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5736)
  This release comes with  a fix for the privileged container breakout discovered earlier this year. As per our policy we don't consider privileged containers root safe and thus LXC as not received a CVE for this. However, we still provide a fix in this release. For more details see [this blog post](https://people.kernel.org/brauner/runtimes-and-the-curse-of-the-privileged-container).

  # Support and upgrade
  LXC 3.2 isn't a LTS release and so will only be supported until such time as LXC 3.3 is released. We recommend users that need a stronger support commitment to stay on one of our LTS releases.
