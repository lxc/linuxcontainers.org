title: LXC 1.0.1 release announcement
date: 2014/03/06 00:00
content: |-
  This is the first bugfix release for the LXC 1.0 series.
  
  ### Changes
  
  Core:
  
   * core: Detect the use of rshared / and properly work around it.
           This fixes LXC on systemd systems where the mount table would be duplicated in the container and lxc-attach wouldn't attach to the container's rootfs.
   * core: Don't crash on invalid lxc.id\_map
   * core: Fix attaching when extra cgroups were setup after the container started
   * core: Fix crash when rebooting container with phys interfaces
   * core: Better detect and report permission problems
   * core: Use common code for any unprivileged action, using newuidmap/newgidmap if available and only falling back to straight writes to uid\_map/gid\_map if they're not and the user is root.
   * core: Fix btrfs snapshot restore
   * core: Fix race in the cloning code potentially leading to data loss
   * core: Don't double-map the root uid/gid
   * core: Fix snapshot restore for overlayfs
   * core: Put logging variables in TLS
  
  Other:
  
   * apparmor: Stop using on-exec for profile changes as it's been proven unreliable on overlayfs at least
   * bash completion: Remove wrong shebang
   * cgmanager: Don't keep an active connection after container start
   * cgmanager: Fix to work with threads
   * doc: Update README
   * lua: Respect --prefix
   * lxc-create: Fix the dir backend to actually respect --dir
   * lxc-device: Properly support wlan devices
   * lxc-ls: Fix --nesting function to work with unprivileged containers
   * lxc-start-ephemeral: Set the tmpfs as 0755 instead of 0777
   * python3: Export missing get\_global\_config\_item function
   * seccomp: Catch violations by init
   * systemd: Fix unit file location
   * templates: Detect system containers inside unprivileged containers (lxc-download)
   * tests: Fix potential hang in lxc-test-concurent
   * upstart: Don't forward requests for LXC\_DOMAIN (dnsmasq)
