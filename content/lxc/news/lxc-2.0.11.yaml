  This is the eleventh bugfix release for LXC 2.0.

  Note that LXC 2.0.10 was released a few days before 2.0.11 but the release tarball was missing some files and wasn't buildable on Android, so we ended up releasing 2.0.11 to address that.

  The changelog below is for everything which happened between 2.0.9 and 2.0.11.

  ### Security fixes
  #### Fixes CVE-2018-6556
  `lxc-user-nic` when asked to delete a network interface would unconditionally open a user provided path. This code path could be used by an unprivileged user to check for the existence of a path which they wouldn't otherwise be able to reach. It may also be used to trigger side effects by causing a (read-only) open of special kernel files (ptmx, proc, sys). For more details see [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6556).

  #### Fixes CVE-2019-5736
  This release fixes [CVE-2019-5736](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5736). It is a major security issue afflicting all container runtimes and is exploitable when attaching to privileged containers. More details on the the bug and how it is fixed can be found [here](https://brauner.github.io/2019/02/12/privileged-containers.html).

  ### Main bugfixes
  #### Allow attaching to undefined containers
  For example the following sequence is now expected to work:

      lxc-start -n <container-name> -f /path/to/conf \
      -s 'lxc.id_map = u 0 100000 65536' \
      -s 'lxc.id_map = g 0 100000 65536' \
      -s 'lxc.rootfs = /path/to/rootfs' \
      -s 'lxc.init_cmd = /path/to/initcmd'

  #### Correctly handle namespace inheritance in attach
  `lxc_attach` will now correctly distinguish between a caller specifying specific namespaces to attach to and a caller not requesting specific namespaces. The latter is taken by `lxc_attach` to mean that all namespaces will be attached. This also needs to include all inherited namespaces.

  #### Allow the creation of `testing` and `unstable` Debian containers
  Being able to create `testing` containers, regardless of what's the name of the next stable, is useful in several contexts, included but not limited to testing purposes. i.e. one won't need to explicitly switch to `bullseye` once `buster` is released to be able to continue tracking `testing`. While we are at it, let's also enable `unstable`, which is exactly the same as `sid`, but there is no reason for not being able to.

  #### Enable container without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` (cgroup handling)
  In case cgroup namespaces are supported but we do not have `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` we need to mount cgroups for the container. This patch enables both privileged and unprivileged containers without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`.

  #### Improved `cgroup2` handling
  Since cgroup2 is becoming more common LXC 2.0.11 comes with a wide range of improvements in that area.

  #### Support read-only mounts of cgroups
  This is especially useful if the container lacks `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and thus cannot remount.

  #### Allow to exit from console via `SIGTERM`
  This allows cleanly exiting a console session without control sequences. Instead `SIGTERM` can be sent to the affected process and it will cause LXC to cleanly terminate the console session.

  #### Correctly calculate the number of arguments passed when running application containers
  The number of arguments passed to `exec` was miscalculated under certain conditions. This release ensure that the correct number of arguments is calculated and passed to `exec.`

  #### Remove all unneeded locking from the codebase
  Older version of LXC used mutexes in various places to ensure thread-safety. Careful redesign of these codepaths has enabled us to remove all mutextes from the codebase. This has led to simplifications and speedups for various operations such as container start and stop.

  #### Fix cgroup namespace preservation
  This eliminates a race and makes sure that the cached file descriptor refers to the container's cgroup namespace and not to the hosts'.

  #### Allow application to share the hosts' pid namespace
  Prior versions of LXC did not allow to share the hosts' pid namespace. Starting with this bugfix release it is possible to do this correctly.

  #### Correctly handle very short-lived application containers
  Prior versions had trouble to correctly handle extremely short-lived application containers. For example, LXC could incorrectly report that a container is still running when it had already shut down due to a TOCTU and refuse to restart it. This caused unnecessary delay. Also, output of such short-lived containers written to stdout could get lost or truncated. This release fixes both issues.

  #### Correctly handle containers where `/proc` has been mount with `hidepid=1` or `hidepid=2`
  In prior versions attaching to unprivileged containers as an unprivileged user with `/proc` mounted with `hidepid=1` or `hidepid=2` would fail since LXC could not retrieve needed information from `/proc`. This is now fixed.

  #### Allow to force mount cgroups even when cgroup namespaces are supported
  This lets users specify `lxc.mount.auto = cgroup:mixed:force` or `lxc.mount.auto = cgroup:ro:force` or `lxc.mount.auto = cgroup:rw:force`.

  When cgroup namespaces are supported LXC will not mount cgroups for the container since it assumes that the init system will mount cgroups itself if it wants to. This assumption already broke when users wanted to run containers without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

  For example, systemd based containers wouldn't start since systemd needs to mount cgroups (named systemd hierarchy for legacy    cgroups and the unified hierarchy for unified cgroups) to track processes. This problem was solved by detecting whether the container had CAP_SYS_ADMIN. If it didn't we performed the cgroup mounts for it.

  However, there are more cases when we should be able to mount cgroups for the container when cgroup namespaces are supported:

    - init systems not mounting cgroups themselves:
      A init system that doesn't mount cgroups would not have cgroups available especially when combined with custom LSM profiles to prevent cgroup {u}mount()ing inside containers.
    - application containers:
      Application containers will usually not mount by cgroups themselves.
    - read-only cgroups:
      It is useful to be able to mount cgroups read-only to e.g. prevent changing cgroup limits from inside the container while at the same time allowing the applications to perform introspection on their own cgroups. This again is mostly useful for application containers. System containers running systemd will usually not work correctly when cgroups are mounted read-only.

  #### Everything else
  2.0.11 includes almost a year and a half of bugfixes cherry-picked from current LXC, the entire list can be found below.
