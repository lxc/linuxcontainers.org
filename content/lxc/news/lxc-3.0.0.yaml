  # Introduction
  The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 3.0.0!

  This is the result of over 6 months of intense work since the LXC 2.1.0 release
  This is the third LTS release for the LXC project and will be supported until June 2023.

  # Major changes

  #### All commands support `lxc-start <container-name>` syntax
  The LXC tools now support passing the container name without the `-n` command line flag. For example, you can now run:
  ```
  chb@conventiont|~
  > lxc-start xenial

  chb@conventiont|~
  > lxc-info xenial
  Name:           xenial
  State:          RUNNING
  PID:            12765
  Memory use:     15.24 MiB
  KMem use:       3.72 MiB
  Link:           veth99VMO3
   TX bytes:      858 bytes
   RX bytes:      2.49 KiB
   Total bytes:   3.33 KiB

  chb@conventiont|~
  > lxc-attach xenial
  root@xenial:/# exit

  chb@conventiont|~
  > lxc-stop xenial
  ```

  #### Removed support for all legacy configuration keys
  All legacy configuration keys are unsupported from LXC 3.0 onwards.
  The full list of deprecated keys and their new counterparts can be gathered from the [LXC 2.1 release announcement](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxc-2-1-has-been-released/487).

  The `lxc-update-config` tool can be used to convert an older, now invalid, configuration to the new format.

  #### Full support for the unified cgroup hierarchy including resource limits
  We are pleased to announce that LXC will fully support the new unified cgroup hierarchy (or cgroup v2, cgroup2). To this end we also introduced a new configuration key `lxc.cgroup2.[controller name]` to configure cgroup limits on the unified cgroup hierarchy.
  For detailed information you can read [this blogpost](https://brauner.github.io/2018/02/19/lxc-lands-unified-cgroup-hierarchy-support.html).

  #### Removal of legacy cgmanager and cgfs cgroup drivers
  LXC removed the `cgmanager` and `cgfs` legacy cgroup drivers cleaning up a lot of code in the process. For detailed information you can read [this blogpost](https://brauner.github.io/2018/02/20/lxc-removes-legacy-cgroup-drivers.html).

  #### Splitting out templates and language bindings
  LXC removes the legacy template-based container build system in favor of the new project [distrobuilder](https://github.com/lxc/distrobuilder). For detailed information you can read [this blogpost](https://brauner.github.io/2018/02/27/lxc-removes-legacy-template-build-system.html).

  Note that to simplify migration, the old template scripts and configuration files remain available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/lxc/lxc-templates) and are released along with LXC 3.0.0 as `lxc-templates`.

  The following templates remain in the LXC 3.0 tree and are fully supported:
   - lxc-busybox (mostly used for testing)
     This is a very minimal template which can be used to setup a `busybox` container. As long as the `busybox` binary is found you can always built yourself a very minimal privileged or unprivileged system or application container image; no networking or any other dependencies required. All you need to do is:
      ```
      lxc-create c3 -t busybox
     ```

      [<img src='/uploads/default/original/1X/3719f8fe09f03069e3741d1ba64141f3d9540b54.png' alt='asciicast'>](https://asciinema.org/a/165788)

   - lxc-download (download our pre-built images)
     This template lets you download pre-built images from our image servers. This is likely what currently most users are using to create unprivileged containers.
   - lxc-local (import locally build images (e.g. from distrobuilder))
     This is a new template which consumes standard `LXC` and `LXD` system container images. A container can be created with:
     ```
     lxc-create c1 -t local -- --metadata /path/to/meta.tar.xz --fstree /path/to/rootfs.tar.xz
     ```

     where the `--metadata` flag needs to point to a file containing the metadata for the container. This is simply the standard `meta.tar.xz` file that comes with any pre-built `LXC` container image. The `--fstree` flag needs to point to a filesystem tree. Creating a container is then just:

     [<img src='/uploads/default/original/1X/87cd149d5b1ffc2bfb11e62b26eba610d1a1eb77.png' alt='asciicast'>](https://asciinema.org/a/165783)

   - lxc-oci (use OCI application container images)
     This is the template which can be used to download and run OCI containers. Using it is as simple as:
     ```
     lxc-create c2 -t oci -- --url docker://alpine
     ```
     Here's another asciicast:

     [<img src='/uploads/default/original/1X/e76c06d093d3e9079562ea15fc57656958001683.png' alt='asciicast'>](https://asciinema.org/a/165784)


  #### Moving the cgroup PAM module into the LXC tree
  LXC has always supported fully unprivileged containers, i.e. unprivileged containers run by unprivileged users. An important piece in doing so was a PAM module that created writable cgroups for unprivileged users. This has been moved from the LXCFS tree into the LXC tree itself to make it even easier for users to run fully unprivileged containers.
  For detailed information you can read [this blogpost](https://brauner.github.io/2018/02/28/lxc-includes-cgroup-pam-module.html).

  #### New `OCI` template
  This adds support for creating application containers from OCI formats. 
  Examples:
  - create a container from a local OCI layout in ../oci:

          sudo lxc-create -t oci -n a1 -- -u oci:../oci:alpine

  - create a container pulling from the docker hub.

          sudo lxc-create -t oci -n u1 -- -u docker://ubuntu

     [<img src='/uploads/default/original/1X/e76c06d093d3e9079562ea15fc57656958001683.png' alt='asciicast'>](https://asciinema.org/a/165784)

  The URL is specified in the same format as for `skopeo copy`.

  #### Simple and efficient ringbuffer for console logging
  LXC supports logging the container's console to a file. This had the unfortunate side effect of allowing a user in the container to effectively write as much data as they wanted on the host, possibly bypassing quotas in place for the container.

  This basic implementation was also somewhat annoying to query, having to read a potentially huge file which wasn't reset on container restart.

  LXC 3.0 now introduces a ringbuffer for console logging. This in-memory buffer is size-limited and can be queried through a new function in the LXC API. It can be reset at any time and can be dumped to disk on container shutdown.

  #### Allow seccomp to filter syscalls based on arguments
  In order to support filtering syscalls based on arguments the `seccomp` version `2` specification is extended to the following form:

      syscall_name action [index,value,op,valueTwo] [index,value,op]...

  where the arguments of the tuple `[index,value,valueTwo,op]` have the following meaning:

  1. index (`uint32_t`):
         The index of the syscall argument.
  2. value (`uint64_t`):
         The value for the syscall argument specified by "index".
  3. valueTwo (`uint64_t`, optional):
         The value for the syscall argument specified by "index". This optional value
         is only valid in conjunction with `SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ`.
  4. op (`char *`):
         The operator for the syscall argument. Valid operators are the constants
         - `SCMP_CMP_NE` or `(!=)`
         - `SCMP_CMP_LE`  or `(<=)`
         - `SCMP_CMP_EQ` or `(==)`
         - `SCMP_CMP_GE` or `(>=)`
         - `SCMP_CMP_GT` or  `(>)`
         - `SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ` or `(&=)`

        as defined by `libseccomp >= v2.3.2`.
        For convenience liblxc also understands the standard operator notation indicated in brackets after the libseccomp constants above as an equivalent notation.
        Note that it is legal to specify multiple entries for the same syscall.

  An example for an extended seccomp version 2 profile is:

      2
      blacklist allow
      reject_force_umount  # comment this to allow umount -f;  not recommended
      [all]
      kexec_load errno 1 [0,1,SCMP_CMP_LE][3,1,==][5,1,SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ,1]
      open_by_handle_at errno 1
      init_module errno 1
      finit_module errno 1
      delete_module errno 1
      unshare errno 9 [0,0x10000000,SCMP_CMP_EQ]
      unshare errno 2 [0,0x20000000,SCMP_CMP_EQ]

  #### Support for daemonized app containers
  LXC has been running application container through a minimal init system since its first release in 2008. PID namespaces expect a functional init system capable of handling signals and reaping exiting child processes. This is why application containers always run the application as the second process.
  New versions of LXC will now additionally allow you to run basically any process daemonized:
  [<img src='/uploads/default/original/1X/ef61a968b654bf44f3506d8ccc95d4cd83407e46.png' alt='asciicast'>](https://asciinema.org/a/174498)

  #### Remove all internal symbols from `lxc-*` tools
  The `lxc-*` tools now only entirely rely on the public LXC API.

  #### Handle `/proc` being mounted with the `hidepid={1,2}` property
  This enables attaching to containers when the host's `/proc` filesystem was mounted with the `hidepid={1,2}` option which restricts access to `/proc/PID` directories.

  #### Support mount propagation for mounts
  This adds support for mount propagation (`private`, `shared`, `slave`, `unbindable`, `rprivate`, `rshared`, `rslave`, `runbindable`) to mount entries specified via `lxc.mount.entry` and `lxc.mount.fstab`.

  #### Hardened thread-safety
  - removed all mutexes
  - replaced all calls to `exit()` in child processes with `_exit()`
  - replaced all `F_SETLK`, `F_SETLKW`, `F_GETLK` with  `F_OFD_SETLK`, `F_OFD_SETLKW`, `F_OFD_GETLK` open file description locks
    If open file descriptions locks are not available LXC will fallback to BSD `flock()`s.

  More details can be gathered from [this blogpost](https://brauner.github.io/2018/03/04/locking-in-shared-libraries.html).

  #### Remove `aufs` storage driver
  The `aufs` storage driver has been deprecated since LXC 2.1 and is now officially removed.

  #### Coding style and code cleanups
  Code cleanups have been performed widely across the codebase based on our written down [coding style](https://github.com/lxc/lxc/blob/master/CODING_STYLE.md).

  # New Configuration Keys

  #### `lxc.cgroup2.[controller name]`
  Specify the control group value to be set on the unified cgroup shierarchy. The controller name is the literal name of the control group. The permitted names and the syntax of their values is not dictated by LXC, instead it depends on the features of the Linux kernel running at the time  the  container is started, for example, `lxc.cgroup2.memory.high`.

  #### `lxc.hook.version`
  To pass the arguments in new style via environment variables set to `1` otherwise set to `0` to pass them as arguments.  This  setting  affects  all  hooks arguments  that were traditionally passed as arguments to the script. Specifically, it affects the container name, section (e.g. 'lxc', 'net') and hook type (e.g.  'clone', 'mount', 'pre-mount') arguments. If new-style hooks are used then the arguments will be available as environment  variables. The container name will be set in `LXC_NAME`. (This is set independently of the value used for this config item.) The section will be set `LXC_HOOK_SECTION` and the hook type will be set in `LXC_HOOK_TYPE`.  It also affects how the paths to file descriptors referring to the container's namespaces are  passed. If  set  to  `1`  then  for  each namespace a separate environment variable `LXC_[NAMESPACE IDENTIFIER]_NS` will be set. If set to `0` then the paths will be passed as arguments to the stop hook.

  #### `lxc.execute.cmd`
  Absolute path from container rootfs to the binary to run by default. This configuration options can be set to to specify the default binary for application container started via the `execute()` API call and accompanies the system container based `lxc.init.cmd` configuration key.

  #### `lxc.init.cwd`
  Absolute path inside the container to use as the working directory.

  #### `lxc.proc.[proc file name]`
  Specify the proc file name to be set. The file names available are those listed under the `/proc/PID/` directory.  For example, `lxc.proc.oom_score_adj = 10`.

  #### `lxc.console.buffer.size`
  Setting this option instructs LXC to allocate an in-memory ringbuffer. The container's console output will be written to the ringbuffer.  Note  that ringbuffer  must be at least as big as a standard page size. When passed a value smaller than a single page size LXC will allocate a ringbuffer of a single page size. A page size is usually `4kB`.  The keyword `auto` will cause LXC to allocate a ringbuffer of `128kB`.  When manually specifying a size for  the  ringbuffer the value should be a power of `2` when converted to bytes. Valid size prefixes are `kB`, `MB`, `GB`. (Note that all conversions are based on multiples of `1024`. That means `kb == KiB`, `MB == MiB`, `GB == GiB`.)

  #### `lxc.console.size`
  Setting this option instructs LXC to place a limit on the size of the console log file specified in `lxc.console.logfile`. Note that size of  the  log file  must  be  at  least as big as a standard page size. When passed a value smaller than a single page size LXC will set the size of log file to a single page size. A page size is usually `4kB`.  The keyword `auto` will cause LXC to place a limit of `128kB` on the log file.  When manually  specifying a size for the log file the value should be a power of `2` when converted to bytes. Valid size prefixes are `kB`, `MB`, `GB`. (Note that all conversions are based on multiples of `1024`. That means `kb == KiB`, `MB == MiB`, `GB == GiB`.)  If users want to mirror the console ringbuffer on  disk they should set `lxc.console.size` equal to `lxc.console.buffer.size`.

  #### `lxc.console.rotate`
  Whether  to rotate the console logfile specified in `lxc.console.logfile`.

  #### `relative` option for `lxc.mount.entry`
  A mountpoint specified with the `relative` property set will be taken to be relative to the mounted container root. For instance,

      lxc.mount.entry = /dev/null proc/kcore none bind,relative 0 0 

  Will expand `dev/null` to `${LXC_ROOTFS_MOUNT}/dev/null`, and mount it to `proc/kcore` inside the container.

  #### `force` property for `cgroup` mounts specified via `lxc.mount.auto`
  ##### `cgroup:mixed:force:`
  The force option will cause LXC to perform the cgroup mounts for the container under all circumstances.  Otherwise it is similar to `cgroup:mixed`.  This is mainly useful when the cgroup namespaces are enabled where LXC will normally leave mounting cgroups to the init binary of the container since it is perfectly safe to do so.

  ##### `cgroup:ro:force:`
  The force option will cause LXC to perform the cgroup mounts for the container under all circumstances.  Otherwise it is similar to `cgroup:ro`.  This is mainly useful when the cgroup namespaces are enabled where LXC will normally leave mounting cgroups to the init binary of the container since it is perfectly safe to do so.

  ##### `cgroup:rw:force:`
  The force option will cause LXC to perform the cgroup mounts for the container under all circumstances.  Otherwise it is similar to `cgroup:rw`.  This is mainly useful when the cgroup namespaces are enabled where LXC will normally leave mounting cgroups to the init binary of the container since it is perfectly safe to do so.

  ##### `cgroup-full:mixed:force:`
  The force option will cause LXC to perform the cgroup mounts for the container under all circumstances.  Otherwise it is similar to `cgroup-full:mixed`.  This is mainly useful when the cgroup namespaces are enabled where LXC will normally leave mounting cgroups to the init binary of the container since it is perfectly safe to do so.

  ##### `cgroup-full:ro:force:`
  The force option will cause LXC to perform the cgroup mounts for the container under all circumstances.  Otherwise it is similar to `cgroup-full:ro`.  This is mainly useful when the cgroup namespaces are enabled where LXC will normally leave mounting cgroups to the init binary of the container since it is perfectly safe to do so.

  ##### `cgroup-full:rw:force:`
  The force option will cause LXC to perform the cgroup mounts for the container under all circumstances.  Otherwise it is similar to `cgroup-full:rw`.  This is mainly useful when the cgroup namespaces are enabled where LXC will normally leave mounting cgroups to the init binary of the container since it is perfectly safe to do so.

  #### `lxc.namespace.clone`
  Specify namespaces which the container is supposed to be created with. The namespaces to create are specified as a space separated list. Each namespace must correspond to one of the standard namespace identifiers as seen in the `/proc/PID/ns` directory. When `lxc.namespace.clone` is not explicitly set all namespaces supported by the kernel and the current configuration will be used.

  To create a new `mount`, `net` and `ipc` namespace set `lxc.namespace.clone = mount net ipc`.

  #### `lxc.namespace.keep`
  Specify  namespaces  which the container is supposed to inherit from the process that created it. The namespaces to keep are specified as a space separated list. Each namespace must correspond to one of the standard namespace identifiers as seen in the `/proc/PID/ns` directory.  The  lxc.namespace.keep is a blacklist option, i.e. it is useful when enforcing that containers must keep a specific set of namespaces.

  To keep the `network`, `user` and `ipc` namespace set `lxc.namespace.keep = user net ipc`.

  Note that sharing `pid` namespaces will likely not work with most init systems.

  Note  that  if the container requests a new user namespace and the container wants to inherit the network namespace it needs to inherit the user namespace as well.

  #### `lxc.namespace.share.[namespace identifier]`
  Specify a namespace to inherit from another container or process.  The `[namespace identifier]` suffix needs to be replaced with one  of  the  namespaces that appear in the `/proc/PID/ns` directory.

  To  inherit  the  namespace  from  another  process  set  the  `lxc.namespace.share.[namespace identifier]`  to  the PID of the process, e.g. `lxc.namespace.share.net = 42`.

  To inherit the namespace from another container set the `lxc.namespace.share.[namespace identifier]` to  the  name  of  the  container,  e.g. `lxc.namespace.share.pid = c3`.

  To  inherit the namespace from another container located in a different path than the standard LXC path set the `lxc.namespace.share.[namespace identifier]` to the full path to the container, e.g.  `lxc.namespace.share.user = /opt/c3`.

  In order to inherit namespaces the caller needs to have sufficient privilege over the process or container.

  Note that sharing pid namespaces between system containers will likely not work with most init systems.

  Note that if two processes are in different user namespaces and one process wants to inherit the other's network namespace it usually needs to  inherit the user namespace as well.

  #### `lxc.sysctl.[kernel parameters name]`
  Specify the kernel parameters to be set. The parameters available are those listed under `/proc/sys/`. Note that not all sysctls are namespaced. Changing Non-namespaced sysctls will cause the system-wide setting to be modified.  `sysctl(8)`. If used with no value, LXC will clear the parameters  specified up to this point.

  #### `lxc.hook.start-host`
  A hook to be run in the host's namespace after the container has been setup, and immediately before starting the container init.

  This should satisfy several use cases.  One example is support for CNI.
  For example, replace the network configuration in a root owned container with:

      lxc.net.0.type = empty
      lxc.hook.start-host = /bin/lxc-start-netns

      where /bin/lxc-start-netns contains:

      =================================

      echo "starting" > /tmp/debug
      ip link add host1 type veth peer name peer1
      ip link set host1 master lxcbr0
      ip link set host1 up
      ip link set peer1 netns "${LXC_PID}"
      =================================

  The nic 'peer1' was placed into the container as expected.
  For this to work, we pass the container init's pid as LXC_PID in an environment variable, since lxc-info cannot work at that point.

  #### API extensions

  ##### `console_log()`
  A new API extension

      	int console_log(struct lxc_container *c, struct lxc_console_log *log);

  has been added that supports interacting with the newly added in-memory ringbuffer of the container. The following struct contains available arguments and return values:

  ```
  struct lxc_console_log {
  	/* Clear the console log. */
  	bool clear;

  	/* Retrieve the console log. */
  	bool read;

  	/* This specifies the maximum size to read from the ringbuffer. Setting
  	 * it to 0 means that the a read can be as big as the whole ringbuffer.
  	 * On return callers can check how many bytes were actually read.
  	 * If "read" and "clear" are set to false and a non-zero value is
  	 * specified then up to "read_max" bytes of data will be discarded from
  	 * the ringbuffer.
  	 */
  	uint64_t *read_max;

  	/* Data that was read from the ringbuffer. If "read_max" is 0 on return
  	 * "data" is invalid.
  	 */
  	char *data;
  };
  ```

  ##### `reboot2()`
  This adds `reboot2()` as a new API extension. This function properly wait until a reboot succeeded. It takes a timeout argument. When set to `> 0` `reboot2()` will block until the timeout is reached, if timeout is set to zero `reboot2()` will not block, if set to `-1` `reboot2()` will block indefinitely.

  ##### `MIGRATE_FEATURE_CHECK` for `CRIU` ``migrate()` API call
  For migration optimization features like pre-copy or post-copy migration the support cannot be determined by simply looking at the `CRIU` version.  Features like that depend on the architecture/kernel/criu combination and `CRIU` offers a feature checking interface to query if it is supported.

  This adds a LXC interface to query CRIU for those feature via the `migrate()` API call. For the recent pre-copy migration support in LXD this can be used to automatically detect if pre-copy migration should be used.

  In addition to the existing `migrate()` API commands this adds a new command: `MIGRATE_FEATURE_CHECK`.

  The `struct migrate_opts` is extended by the member `features_to_check` which is a bitmask defining which `CRIU` features should be queried.

  Currently only querying the features `FEATURE_MEM_TRACK` and `FEATURE_LAZY_PAGES` are supported.

  ##### add `LXC_ATTACH_TERMINAL` to `attach()` API call
  Allocation of a new terminal has been moved into the API itself. Callers can  now set `LXC_ATTACH_TERMINAL` to request to be attached to a new terminal allocated from the host's `devpts` mount before attaching to the container.

  # Support and upgrade
  LXC 3.0.0 will be supported until June 2023 and our current LTS release.
  LXC 2.0 will now join LXC 1.0 in only getting critical bugfixes and security updates.

  We strongly recommend all LXC users to plan an upgrade to the 3.0 branch.
  Due to the transition of libpam-cgfs to LXC, this should be done at the same time as the upgrade to LXCFS 3.0 to avoid potential conflicts.
