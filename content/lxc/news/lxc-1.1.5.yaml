  This is the fifth bugfix release for LXC 1.1.
  
  Core:
  
   * Fix handling of process title rename (now only on >= 3.19 kernels)
   * Several improvements to overlayfs/aufs handling
      * Needed directories are created if missing
      * Better handling of absolute paths
      * Better handling of cloning overlayfs containers
   * Ignore trailing /init.scope in cgroup paths (needed for newer systemd)
   * Allow checkpoint/restore of containers using non-bridged veth devices
   * Properly initialize error\_num (exit code tracking for the container)
   * lxc-usernsexec: Re-open fds 0,1,2 separately (only if stdin is a tty)
  
  Init scripts:
  
   * lxc-net: Start after network-online.target
  
  Commands:
  
   * lxc-start: Allow preserving the PID namespace too
  
  Templates:
  
   * archlinux: Fix systemd-sysctl service
   * ubuntu-cloud: Use tar.xz tarballs by default (as tar.gz will soon be discontinued)
   * ubuntu-cloud: Always exit 1 on error
