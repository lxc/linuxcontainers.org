title: LXC 2.1 release announcement
date: 2017/09/05 00:00
content: |-
  The LXC team is proud to announce the release of LXC 2.1.
  This release contains a lot of new features introduced since the release of LXC 2.0.
  
  Note that this isn't a LTS release and we'll therefore only be supporting LXC 2.1 for a year.
  Production environments that require longer term support should remain on LXC 2.0 which is supported until June 2021.
  
  # New features
  ## Resource limit support
  Similar to requesting specific cgroup limits users can specify any limits for any resource
  the underlying kernel is aware of by prefixing the name of the limit with "lxc.prlimit."
  in the container's configuration file. For example, to request a limit on the number of processes
  and a specific nice value the configuration file for the container should contain the entries:
  
      lxc.prlimit.nproc = unlimited
      lxc.prlimit.nice = 4
  
  ## Support for unprivileged openvswitch networks
  It is now possible to define openvswitch networks as an unprivileged user:
  
      lxc.net.0.type = veth
      lxc.net.0.link = ovsbr0
      lxc.net.0.flags = up
      lxc.net.0.name = eth0
  
  LXC 2.1. will take care to properly delete the host-side veth device from the
  openvswitch database on shutdown.
  
  ## New `lxc.cgroup.dir` key
  The `lxc.cgroup.dir` key lets users specify the name of the parent cgroup under
  which the container's cgroup will be created. Setting `lxc.cgroup.dir` will
  override the system-wide setting for `lxc.cgroup.pattern`.
  
  For example, setting `lxc.cgroup.dir = mycontainers` for a container with `lxc.uts.name = c1`
  will cause LXC to create the cgroups `mycontainers/c1` for all controllers in the cgroup hierarchy.
  
  ## Support for hybrid cgroup layout
  Since the advent of cgroup v2 some init systems have decided to allow for a hybrid mode in which
  cgroup v1 per-controller hierarchies can be used simultaneously with an empty cgroup v2 hierarchy.
  Systems that use this hybrid mode usually have a cgroup layout similar to this one:
  
        /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
        /sys/fs/cgroup/devices
        /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
        /sys/fs/cgroup/unified
  
  Where the mountpoint `/sys/fs/cgroup/unified` usually indicates the presence of a cgroup v2 hierarchy.
  This can be confirmed by testing whether `findmnt | grep cgroup2` returns a matching line.
  LXC 2.1 supports this hybrid mode.
  
  ## Limiting the number of ptys a container can allocate
  Setting `lxc.pty.max` will cause LXC to mount the container's devpts with the requested limit
  on the number of usable ptys. For example, setting `lxc.pty.max = 10` will only allow
  the container to allocate `10` ptys. The default setting is `1024`.
  
  ## `bool lxc_config_item_is_supported(const char *key)` API extension
  This function let's users query the liblxc whether a specific configuration item is supported for this library.
  This is particularly useful for embedded users that running versions of liblxc that come with significantly
  less configuration options than the standard liblxc library or liblxc's that have backported new configuration items.
  
  ## New log API extension
  
      struct lxc_log {
          const char *name;
          const char *lxcpath;
          const char *file;
          const char *level;
          const char *prefix;
          bool quiet;
      };
  
      /*!
       *\brief Initialize the log
       *
       *\param log lxc log configuration.
       */
      int lxc_log_init(struct lxc_log *log);
  
      /*!
       * \brief Close log file.
       */
      void lxc_log_close(void);
  
  These types and functions let users initialize LXC logging. This is useful for users who use the liblxc API directly.
  
  ## Deprecation of `lxc-monitord`
  Starting with LXC 2.1 the `lxc-monitord` binary is marked as deprecated.
  It is not required anymore to start daemonized containers. Instead, LXC 2.1 switches to an implementation using
  an abstract unix domain socketpair. This has the advantage of spawning one less processes on container startup which is
  important for highly threaded users such as `LXD`.
  
  Also, testing the new implementation on heavy workloads has shown this solution to be more robust and reliable in every way.
  
  ## `lxc-copy` create snapshots on `tmpfs`
  Place an ephemeral container started with -e flag on a tmpfs.
  Restrictions are that you cannot request the data to be kept while placing the container on a tmpfs,
  that either overlay or aufs backing storage must be used, and that the storage backend of the original
  container must be a directory.
  
  For ephemeral snapshots backed by overlay or aufs filesystems, a fresh tmpfs is mounted over the containers directory
  if the user requests it. This should be the easiest options. Anything else would require us to change the current
  mount-layout of overlay and aufs snapshots. A standard overlay or aufs snapshot clone currently has the layout:
  
              /var/lib/lxc/CLONE_SNAPSHOT/delta0      <-- upperdir
              /var/lib/lxc/CLONE_SNAPSHOT/rootfs
              /var/lib/lxc/CLONE_SNAPSHOT/olwork
              /var/lib/lxc/CLONE_SNAPSHOT/olwork/work <-- workdir
  
      with the lowerdir being
  
              /var/lib/lxc/CLONE_PARENT/rootfs
  
  The fact that upperdir and workdir are not placed in a common subfolder under the container directory
  has the consequence that we cannot simply mount a fresh tmpfs under upperdir and workdir
  because overlay expects them to be on the same filesystem.
  
  Because we mount a fresh tmpfs over the directory of the container the updated /etc/hostname file created
  during the clone residing in the upperdir (currently named "delta0" by default) will be hidden.
  
  Hence, if the user requests that the old name is not to be kept for the clone, we recreate this file on the tmpfs.
  This should be all that is required to restore the exact behaviour we would get with a normal clone.
  NOTE: If the container is rebooted all changes made to it are lost. This is not easy to prevent since each reboot remounts the rootfs again.
  
  # Configuration changes
  A lot of configuration keys have been renamed to make the experience of configuring a container much more consistent.
  LXC 2.1 ensures that all keys that have subkeys are properly namespaces via the "." syntax.
  
  ## Network configuration
  The network configuration keys have all been given a new prefix. Some of them  have also been renamed.
  From LXC 2.1. onwards network configuration keys using the "lxc.network" prefix are considered deprecated.
  They are replaced by network configuration keys using the new "lxc.net" prefix.
  Furthermore, defining network without indices is marked deprecated.
  Consider the following *legacy* network configuration:
  
      lxc.network.type = veth
      lxc.network.flags = up
      lxc.network.link = lxcbr0
      lxc.network.name = wlp2s0
  
      lxc.network.type = veth
      lxc.network.flags = up
      lxc.network.link = lxcbr0
      lxc.network.name = eno1
  
  Would define two distinct networks. Starting with LXC 2.1 this should be replaced with:
  
      lxc.net.0.type = veth
      lxc.net.0.flags = up
      lxc.net.0.link = lxcbr0
      lxc.net.0.name = wlp2s0
  
      lxc.net.1.type = veth
      lxc.net.1.flags = up
      lxc.net.1.link = lxcbr0
      lxc.net.1.name = eno1
  
  Defining networks only in this manner has the advantage of being consistent and order independent.
  This means an equivalent configuration for the two networks would be:
  
      lxc.net.1.link = lxcbr0
      lxc.net.0.name = wlp2s0
      lxc.net.0.type = veth
  
      lxc.net.1.type = veth
      lxc.net.1.flags = up
      lxc.net.0.flags = up
      lxc.net.0.link = lxcbr0
      lxc.net.1.name = eno1
  
  
  Note that when using multiple definitions of the same key with the same index only the last one
  will be considered by LXC. This is in line with prior LXC version. For example:
  
      lxc.net.2.link = lxcbr0
      lxc.net.2.link = lxdbr0
      lxc.net.2.link = br0
      lxc.net.2.link = virbr0
  
  would lead to LXC associating the network with `virbr0` since it is the last key in the configuration.
  
  ## Table of changed configuration keys
  The following table lists the legacy configuration keys on the left side and their corresponding new keys on the right side. Keys that have been entirely removed will have "-" as entry in the "New Key" column and a comment saying "removed" in the "Comments" table.

  ## `lxc-update-config` script
  LXC 2.1 comes with a new script `lxc-update-config` which can be used to upgrade existing legacy
  LXC configurations to valid LXC 2.1 configurations by simply passing
  
      lxc-update-config -c /path/to/config
  
  The script will create a backup of the legacy configuration file first.
  The name of the backup config file will by `<original-config-file-name>.backup`.
  The backup is made in case the upgrade does not yield a usable LXC 2.1 config file.
  After creating the backup the script will replace all legacy configuration keys with their new counterparts.
  
  # Deprecation warnings
  LXC 2.1 intends to be fully backward compatible with respect to pre-2.1 configuration files.
  This specifically means that the presence of any deprecated keys should not prevent the container from being usable.
  However, LXC 2.1 will warn about the presence of any deprecated configuration keys.
  On container startup LXC 2.1 will warn *once* with the message:
  
      The configuration file contains legacy configuration keys.
      Please update your configuration file.
  
  All users are advised to use the aforementioned `lxc-update-config` script to update their configuration files.
  If the container has logging enabled the log will contain warnings for each detected legacy configuration key.
  This is mostly useful for users who prefer to update their configuration files manually.
