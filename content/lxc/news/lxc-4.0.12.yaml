  # Introduction
  The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 4.0.12!

  This is the twelfth bugfix release for LXC 4.0 which is supported until June 2025.

  # Bugfixes
  As usual this bugfix releases focus on stability and hardening. Some of the highlights for this release are:

   - Fixed issue with kernels lacking SMT support
   - Extended cgroup2 config options in lxc.mount.auto (cgroup2)
