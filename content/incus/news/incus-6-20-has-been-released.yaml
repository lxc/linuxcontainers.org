  # Introduction
  The Incus team is pleased to announce the release of Incus 6.20!

  This is the last release of 2025 and a shorter development cycle so we don't end up releasing right in the middle of the holidays!

  [![image|690x383](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/uploads/default/original/2X/1/174fe2a5949b2d896dff950795bc1556f6237a90.jpeg)](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/)

  As usual, you can try it for yourself online: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/

  Enjoy!

  # New features
  ## QCOW2 formatted volumes on clustered LVM
  An annoying limitation of our implementation of LVM cluster was that VM snapshots weren't working reliably on all LVM versions.

  Newer LVM versions introduced an activation mode restriction which would prevent us from using shared locking mode and therefore prevent us from performing live migration.

  Back in Incus 6.18 we effectively turned off snapshots on all block volumes running on clustered LVM so we'd have a consistent user experience and avoid issues when users upgrade their operating system to a new major version.

  Now we finally have implemented our new solution for snapshots on top of clustered LVM. It uses QCOW2 formatting on the LVs rather than standard raw formatting. This then lets us manually handle the composition of the LVM LVs to make a snapshot chain leading to the correct VM state.

  The new format will be automatically used for any new VMs. Existing VMs remain on the raw disk format and so will not support snapshots. It's possible to convert to QCOW2 by moving the instance to another storage pool and then move it back.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/storage_lvm/

  ## Standalone `incus cluster join` command
  This one is motivated by [IncusOS](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/) where every Incus interaction must be done remotely using the Incus command line or UI. While it was possible for a user to initialize a new cluster remotely using `incus cluster enable`, joining additional IncusOS servers into that cluster was rather difficult.

  To make this as easy as possible, we now have a new `incus cluster join` command which takes both the existing cluster and the server to be joined as arguments. It will then ask questions similar to `incus admin init` and lead to the server joining the cluster.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus cluster join incus01: incus02:
      What IP address or DNS name should be used to reach this server? [default=10.244.64.185]:·
      What member name should be used to identify this server in the cluster? [default=eb7bbd3f-d385-4a06-919f-d66a7c52b058]: incus02
      All existing data is lost when joining a cluster, continue? (yes/no) [default=no] yes

  ## Configuration file for the VM agent
  It's now possible to restrict what kind of actions can be performed through the Incus agent. This is done through a system configuration file which lists a set of enabled features. If the file exists and the feature list is present, then all features are disabled unless explicitly enabled.


  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/instances_create/#configure-the-incus-agent

  ## Reverse DNS records in OVN
  A very small but potentially quite useful addition. All instances running on OVN now get both forward and reverse DNS records generated for their addresses.
