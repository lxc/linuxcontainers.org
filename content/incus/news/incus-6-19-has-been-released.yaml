  # Introduction
  The Incus team is pleased to announce the release of Incus 6.19!

  This is a slightly less busy release than usual as we've recently been spending quite a bit of time smoothing some of the initial rough edges from the [IncusOS release](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/announcing-incusos/25139).

  That said, it still contains quite a few nice improvements and quite a lot of bugfixes!

  As usual, you can try it for yourself online: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/

  Enjoy!

  # New features
  ## Initial SELinux support
  With this release, we now have the very first steps in having native SELinux support in Incus. It's still very early in this effort and as a result, this feature is disabled by default, requiring `INCUS_SECURITY_SELINUX=true` being set in the environment to have the feature enabled.

  As it stands, with the feature enabled, Incus will detect SELinux support on the system and attempt to detect one of two SELinux environments:

   - The current Fedora/RHEL set of SELinux contexts
   - The SELinux refpolicy setup for Incus

  When running on a supported system, Incus will then apply the expected SELinux context to containers, including the generation of a unique set of SELinux categories.

  This is effectively to prevent any potential interaction between two containers even if they otherwise share the same SELinux context.

  As it stands, only the runtime context is set. Incus doesn't yet interact with the filesystem context, nor does it handle virtual machines or shared volumes and resources.

  We'd encourage anyone with experience/interest in getting full SELinux support in Incus to try this out and work with us in extending our support!

      [root@fedora ~]# journalctl -u incus | grep -i selinux

  ## Improved Windows agent support
  Incus now has support for running its WIndows agent as a service, including installation scripts similar to those available on both Linux and MacOS.

  With that in place, we now have a very similar user experience whether you're running Linux, MacOS or Windows in your Incus VMs.

  This work was followed up with an improvement to the Ansible connection plugin to have it support all three platforms as well.

  ## Serial devices in the resources API
  This one came up from early IncusOS feedback from folks using Incus to run IoT containers with USB serial devices to interact with things like Zigbee and Z-Wave networks.

  On a regular system, one could go inspect /dev/serial to figure out a stable identifier for those USB serial adapters. But with the locked down IncusOS environment, this wasn't easily possible.

  To address that, the resources API now contains a list of serial devices with all the necessary details to select and pass them to a container.

  ## Bandwidth limits on OVN NICs
  OVN network interfaces can now make use of the `limits.ingress`, `limits.egress`, `limits.max` and `limits.priority` configuration keys.

  Those are all converted to relevant OVN QoS rules.

  ## Support for multi-object deletion in most CLI commands
  The following CLI commands can now delete more than one item at once:

   - `incus cluster group delete`
   - `incus image alias delete`
   - `incus network delete`
   - `incus network acl delete`
   - `incus network address-set delete`
   - `incus network integration delete`
   - `incus network zone delete`
   - `incus operation delete`
   - `incus profile delete`
   - `incus project delete`
   - `incus storage delete`
   - `incus warning delete`

  ## Ability to turn off passthrough of PCI firmware to VM
  A new `firmware` configuration key has been added to `pci` type devices.
  This can be set to `false` to have the device exclude its ROM section.

  That's occasionally required for proper operation of PCI devices in VMs.

  ## PKCS12 generation in the CLI
  With more people getting started with the Incus web UI, a common pain point was generating a certificate file suitable for import in a web browser.

  To make this easier, the existing `incus remote get-client-certificate` command has been expanded.

  It now both supports writing a regular PEM encoded public certificate to a file with `incus remote get-client-certificate client.crt` as well as generating a PKCS12 certificate bundle (includes the private key) using `incus remote get-client-certificate client.pfx --format=pfx`.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus remote get-client-certificate browser.pfx --format=pfx
      Password for browser.pfx:·
      stgraber@castiana:~$ ls -lh browser.pfx·
      -rw------- 1 stgraber stgraber 1.2K Nov 29 16:35 browser.pfx

  ## Option for raw units in CLI CSV output
  A new `raw` option on top of the `csv` format in CLI lists allows for getting our various resource data as raw bytes rather than as a human readable string.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus list -cnm -fcsv
      c1,9.57MiB
      dev-os,1.06GiB
      nginx,2.14MiB
      test,7.57MiB
      test1,7.89MiB

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus list -cnm -fcsv,raw
      c1,10293248
      dev-os,1141211136
      nginx,2240512
      test,7938048
      test1,8278016
