  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 3.18!

  This release includes a lot of the preliminary work needed in order to implement [virtual machine support](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/6205) alongside containers in future LXD releases. LXD 3.18 comes with a number of API additions and changes to the Go client and CLI tools to allow driving virtual machines.

  The bulk of this is the slow replacement of `containers` in the API and internal code base for the more generic `instances` which will then encompass both containers and virtual machines.

  The vast majority of that work will currently be invisible to our normal users, everything was done to make this fully backward compatible, so older API clients will keep working as usual.

  As far as immediately usable improvements, this release extends our resources API to expose more disk information, adds the ability to alter image expiry dates, switches to a new clustering role mechanism and allows some more configuration options when using Fan networking.

  Enjoy!

  ### New features
  #### New /1.0/instances endpoint
  Part of the move to supporting virtual machines is the replacement of our current `/1.0/containers` API with a new `/1.0/instances` API which will then return both containers and virtual machines. The structure of this new API endpoint is identical and the former endpoint is now just a type filter on top of the new one.

  For consistency, once virtual machine support is ready, we will also be providing a `/1.0/virtual-machines` endpoint, which will similarly type filter `/1.0/instances` and only show virtual machines.

  As part of this work, the Go client package was also modified to include new functions for all the `/1.0/instances` endpoints, detecting the availability of that new API and falling back to the old one when interacting with an older LXD server.

  Our command line tool (`lxc`) was then updated to use those new functions too.

  #### Support for storing VM images
  This release of LXD is able to query virtual machine images from other LXD servers and from simplestreams servers where such images are already available.
  Current the only two servers which have such images are `ubuntu:` and `ubuntu-daily:`.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc image list ubuntu: serial=20190918 release=bionic architecture=amd64

      +-------------+--------------+--------+---------------------------------------------+--------+-----------------+----------+-------------------------------+

  In the example above, we can see 3 versions of the same image, the first being a qcow2 virtual machine image, the second being a squashfs container image and the third being a tar.xz container image.

  VM images can be copied to a local LXD server:

      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc image copy ubuntu:b local: --vm --alias b-vm
      Image copied successfully!                   
      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc image list

      +-------+--------------+--------+---------------------------------------------+--------+-----------------+----------+-----------------------------+

  Note that while all of this works already, without LXD being able to run virtual machines, we don't expect this to be particularly useful to anyone at this point.

  #### Extended disk resources information
  The `storage` section of our `/1.0/resources` API was extended to provide more information on a variety of disks, this now includes:

   - Firmware version
   - Device path
   - Serial number
   - RPM
   - A more detailed `type`, including detection of cdrom drives

  Example output on a system with a variety of drives:

      root@lantea:~# lxc query /1.0/resources | jq .storage

  #### Modification of image expiry date
  Thanks to a contribution from students at the University of Texas in Austin, it is now possible to edit the expiry of an image in the LXD image store.

  This can be done through `lxc image edit`, modifying the `expires_at` timestamp.

  #### Clustering roles
  In preparation for future clustering work, a new way to report the role of cluster members has been added. This is a list of roles attached directly to the member. Currently, the only role supported is `database` and indicates that the cluster member is one of the database servers.

      root@lantea:~# lxc cluster show lantea
      server_name: lantea
      url: https://[2001:470:b0f8:1016:d250:99ff:fec2:9263]:8443
      database: true
      status: Online
      message: fully operational
      roles:
      - database

  This feature will soon be used as the basis for two new roles:

  ##### eventhub
  Cluster members with this role will be receiving events from other cluster members and synchronize events with other event hubs. This will replace the current event handling approach of having every cluster member notify every other cluster member, reducing bandwidth and CPU usage when sending events.

  ##### database_standby
  Cluster members with this role will be receiving the live database stream, similar to normal database members. The difference is that those will not be voting members in the raft consensus, meaning that such members can be added without increasing the time needed for a database transaction to be committed.

  Those standby database nodes can then be promoted to voting members very quickly, making clusters much more resilient and allowing for maintenance activities like rolling updates without the risk of taking down the cluster database.

  #### IPv4 configuration when in Fan mode
  Networks in Fan mode may now configure:

   - ipv4.dhcp.expiry
   - ipv4.firewall
   - ipv4.nat
   - ipv4.nat.order
