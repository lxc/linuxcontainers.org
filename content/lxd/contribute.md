and not on stable releases, unless the bug only affects a stable release.

# Patch submission process

Contributions to LXD must be submitted as Github pull-requests and we require them to be signed-off.

# Stable release backports

In general, all bugfixes will be picked up for the stable release, this however tends to happen in batches  
every couple of months or so. If we missed a given patch, please file a bug so we can look into it.

Note that only bugfixes are backported to stable releases.
