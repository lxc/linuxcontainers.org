            <h1>Infrastructure for container projects.</h1>
            <p>linuxcontainers.org is the umbrella project behind LXC,
       LXD and LXCFS.</p>

            <p>The goal is to offer a distro and vendor neutral environment
            for the development of Linux container technologies.</p>

            <p>Our main focus is system containers. That is, containers which
            offer an environment as close as possible as the one you'd get from a
            VM but without the overhead that comes with running a separate
            kernel and simulating all the hardware.</p>

            <h3>LXC</h3>
            <p>LXC is the well known set of tools, templates,
            library and language bindings. It's pretty low
            level, very flexible and covers just about every
            containment feature supported by the upstream
            kernel.</p>
            <p>LXC is production ready with LXC 1.0 getting 5
            years of security updates and bugfixes
            (until April 2019).</p>

            <h3>LXD</h3>
            <p>LXD is the new LXC experience. It offers a
            completely fresh and intuitive user experience
            with a single command line tool to manage your
            containers. Containers can be managed over the
            network in a transparent way through a REST API.
            It also works with large scale deployments by
            integrating with OpenStack.</p>

            <h3>LXCFS</h3>
            <p>Userspace (FUSE) filesystem offering two main things:
                <ul>
                    <li>Overlay files for cpuinfo, meminfo, stat and uptime.</li>
                    <li>A cgroupfs compatible tree allowing unprivileged writes.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>It's designed to workaround the shortcomings of procfs, sysfs
            and cgroupfs by exporting files which match what a system
            container user would expect.</p>

            <h3>CGManager</h3>
            <p>CGManager is our cgroup manager daemon. It's
            designed to allow nested unprivileged containers
            to still be able to create and manage their
            cgroups through a DBus API.</p>

            <p>CGManager was used by default with LXC in
            Ubuntu since April 2014 and then by other
            distributions as they started needing working
            unprivileged containers.</p>

            <p>It has now been deprecated in favor of the CGroup namespace
            in recent Linux kernels. On older kernels, LXCFS still offers
            a cgroupfs emulation that can be used instead of cgmanager
            and is more widely compatible with existing userspace.</p>
