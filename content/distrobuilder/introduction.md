# What's distrobuilder?
`distrobuilder` is an image building tool for LXC and LXD.

It's used to build all our official images available on [our image server](https://images.linuxcontainers.org).

The image definition is a YAML document which describes the source of the image, its package manager, what packages to install/remove for specific image variants, os releases and architectures, as well as additional files to generate and arbitrary actions to execute as part of the image build process.

The output is either a plain root filesystem, a LXD image or a LXC image.

You can see it at work here: [https://jenkins.linuxcontainers.org/view/Images/](https://jenkins.linuxcontainers.org/view/Images/)
