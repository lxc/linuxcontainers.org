  ### Introduction
  The distrobuilder team is proud to announce its initial release, distrobuilder 1.2!

  This release's highlight is the introduction of Windows image repacking.

  LXD is able to run Windows VMs; for that it needs a Windows ISO and a bunch of specific drivers from a separate ISO which need to be loaded during the Windows installation.

  To make things easier, `distrobuilder` has added the `repack-windows` command which takes both a Windows ISO and an ISO containing the specific drivers, and bundles them together. With the resulting ISO, Windows can be installed easily.

  With this release also come support for Go modules, and basic context logging. For a more detailed log output, the `--debug` flag can be used.
