  Critical bug/security fix update for LXCFS.
  
  Prior versions of LXCFS would replace the host's /proc with the container's
  when a read to /proc/uptime was done on a system with / mounted rshared (default on systemd).
  
  This release includes ONLY this bugfix and should be immediately deployed by anyone currently using lxcfs.
