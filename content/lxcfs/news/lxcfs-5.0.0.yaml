  # Introduction
  The LXCFS team is pleased to announce the release of LXCFS 5.0.0!

  This is the result of two years of work since the LXCFS 4.0.0 release and is the fourth LTS release for the LXCFS project. This release will be supported until June 2027.

  # Major changes
  ## Switch to meson
  With this release of LXCFS, autotools is being replaced by `meson` as the build tooling. Compatibility `Makefile` targets are provided for `all`, `install` and `dist`.

  This is a change which is particularly relevant for packagers as it otherwise has no user visible impact.

  ## CGroup2 support
  LXCFS 5.0 properly detects and handles cgroup2, using the cgroup2 hierarchy to fetch the resource consumption information for the container. It also automatically disables the `cgroup` directory feature when run on a cgroup2 system.

  ## /proc/slabinfo support
  The per-cgroup slab allocation is now used to provide a container view of `/proc/slabinfo`.

  ## /sys/devices/system/cpu/ support
  In addition to the existing `/sys/devices/system/cpu/online` support, LXCFS will now virtualize the entire `/sys/devices/system/cpu` directory in order to hide CPUs which aren't available to the container.

  # Support and upgrade
  LXCFS 5.0.0 will be supported until June 2027 and our current LTS release, LXCFS 4.0 will now switch to a slower maintenance pace, only getting critical bugfixes and security updates.

  We strongly recommend all LXCFS users to plan an upgrade to the 5.0 branch.
