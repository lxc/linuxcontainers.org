  ### Introduction
  The LXCFS team is pleased to announce the release of LXCFS 3.0.0!

  This is the result of two years of work since the LXCFS 2.0.0 release
  This is the second LTS release for the LXCFS project and will be supported until June 2023.

  ### Major changes
  The most significant change to LXCFS 3.0.0 is the removal of the PAM module `libpam-cgfs` which has now been moved to the LXC codebase instead.

  This was motivated by the fact that all LXC users, whether they use LXCFS or not can benefit from that PAM module and that much more code can be shared with LXC than it could with LXCFS.

  All other changes included in LXCFS 3.0.0 are considered to be bugfixes and have or will be backported to the LXCFS 2.0 branch, making this a very lightweight update.

  ### Support and upgrade
  LXCFS 3.0.0 will be supported until June 2023 and our current LTS release, LXCFS 2.0 will now switch to a slower maintenance pace, only getting critical bugfixes and security updates.

  We strongly recommend all LXCFS users to plan an upgrade to the 3.0 branch.
  Due to the transition of libpam-cgfs to LXC, this should be done at the same time as the upgrade to LXC 3.0 to avoid regressions.
