title: LXCFS 0.1 release announcement
date: 2015/01/09 00:00
content: |-

  This is the initial LXCFS release.
  
  It offers a basic cgroupfs-like interface which writes through CGManager as well as
  cgroup-ified versions of the cpuinfo, meminfo, stat and uptime proc files.
  
  
  Note that as the first release of LXCFS, things can still be very rough and we would advice
  against using this in production.
