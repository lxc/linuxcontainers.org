  ### Introduction
  The LXCFS team is pleased to announce the release of LXCFS 3.1.2!

  We had to re-roll the 3.1.0 release twice, first because of a bad Makefile causing an invalid release tarball to be generated, then again to fix an upgrade issue affecting some users of LXCFS 3.0.4

  #### New features

  #### Add support for per-container cpu usage in `/proc/stat`
  Newer LXCFS releases make it possible to virtualize cpu usage per container by using the `cpuacct` cgroup.

  #### Add support for load average (`loadavg`) virtualization
  LXCFS now supports virtualizing `/proc/loadavg`. It will calculate the loadavg for a container based on the `cpu` cgroup.

  #### Display cpus in `/proc/cpuinfo` based on cpu quotas
  LXCFS will virtualize the cpus displayed in `/proc/cpuinfo` using the `cpu` cgroup and quotas calculated there.

  #### Allow to disable swap in `/proc/meminfo` output
  This adds the `-u` option to disable swap info output in `/proc/meminfo`.

  #### Virtualize `/sys/devices/system/cpu/online`
  LXCFS now also partially virtualizes `sysfs`. The first file to virtualize is `/sys/devices/system/cpu/online` per container.

  #### Enable higher precision output in `/proc/uptime`
  The calculations for `/proc/uptime` are now more correct.

  #### Add support for FUSE `nonempty` option
  The `lxcfs` binary can now be passed the `-d` option. When passed, `lxcfs` will also start when the mountpoint is not empty.

  #### Bugfixes

  - bindings: ensure that opts is non NULL
  - Makefile: Fix typo in file name
  - remove unused functions
  - sys dirs do not need to implement 'read' method
  - lxcfs: coding style update
  - config: Adds RPM spec file.
  - config: Adds reload mode to sysvinit and systemd scripts.
  - bindings: prevent NULL pointer dereference
  - stat: check for out of bound access to cpuacct usage data
  - calc_hash(): do not apply modulo LOAD_SIZE
  - tests: include missing sys/sysmacros.h header
  - bindings: prevent double free
  - bindings: better logging for write_string()
  - meminfo: set ShmemHugePages and ShmemPmdMapped to zero
  - bindings: fix memory leak in calc_pid()
  - travis: fix .travis.yml
  - bindings: fix memory leak in proc_loadavg_read()

  ### Support and upgrade
  LXCFS 3.1.2 is only supported until the next feature release of LXCFS.
  For long term support, you should prefer LXCFS 3.0.4 LTS which is supported until June 2023.
