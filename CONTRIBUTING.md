# Developer Certificate of Origin

To improve tracking of contributions to this project we use the DCO 1.1
and use a "sign-off" procedure for all changes going into the branch.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
commit which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right
to pass it on as an open-source contribution.

An example of a valid sign-off line is:

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>

Use your real name and a valid e-mail address.
Sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are allowed.

**Note:**
* Sign-off each commit individually, even when it is part of a larger set.
* If multiple authors are participating, sign-off each commit individually by their author.

You can for example use [git commit -s](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s) to sign-off each commit.

# Commits

* Prefer smaller commits over large commits: For example one for each section
* Add useful messages to your commits, that describe the content or changes
